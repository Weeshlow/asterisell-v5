Overview
========

Start with CSV files produced from each VoIP server.

Perform a calls flow merge, producing a single CDR.

CProceduresGenerator.php parse an high level specification of call flow merge rules, 
and produce C code that must be compiled togheter with the rest of the code,
for obtaining the final tool.

Ragel parser/state-machine is used for parsing the CSV fields.

Judy arrays are used for retrieving CDR matching the call flow.

The final tool is called from the PHP code, inside CDR jobs.

Status
======

Does not work (require porting) in version 5 of Asterisell.

Works on version 4 of Asterisell.

Development Notes
=================

This project is in C instead of C++ because I'm using the JudyArray library
that can not be compiled without errors inside C++ (at level of macro).

This code uses RAGEL parse generator, that is rather low-level to use,
and the resulting code is not so elegant, due to my inexperience in using
RAGEL in a more elegant mode.

MakeFile
========

It is produced from 

  CProceduresGenerator.php 

code.
