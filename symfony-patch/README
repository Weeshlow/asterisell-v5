Some PATCH to apply to the 1.0 version of the Symfony framework.

In my Debian distribution it is located in the directories:

  * /usr/share/php/symfony (the symfony "lib" directory)
  * /usr/share/php/data/symfony (the symfony "data" directory)

In order to test the PATCH execute:

  cd /usr/share/php/data/symfony

  patch --dry-run -i /var/www/asterisell/symfony-patch/PATCH_SORT_ON_COLUMN -p2

If the dry-run execution of patch does not signal any problem then you can apply the patch:

  patch -i /var/www/asterisell/symfony-patch/PATCH_SORT_ON_COLUMN -p2
